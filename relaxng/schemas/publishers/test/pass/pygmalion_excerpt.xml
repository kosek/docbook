                <para>She sits down on the plinth of the column, sorting herflowers, on the lady's
                    right. She is not at all an attractive person.She is perhaps eighteen, perhaps
                    twenty, hardly older. She wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long
                    been exposed to the dustand soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed.
                    Her hair needs washing rather badly: its mousy color can hardly be natural. She
                    wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to her
                    waist. She has a brown skirt with a coarse apron. Her boots aremuch the worse
                    for wear. She is no doubt as clean as she can afford tobe; but compared to the
                    ladies she is very dirty. Her features are no worse than theirs; but their
                    condition leaves something to be desired;and she needs the services of a
                    dentist.</para>
